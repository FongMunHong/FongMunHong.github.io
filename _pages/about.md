Hi, I am Mun Hong (both are my first name), currently a first year PhD student at [Duke University](https://duke.edu/), advised by [Rohit Singh](https://singhlab.net/) and working with [Alex Tong](https://www.alextong.net/). I am deeply interested in therapeutic design, especially in biomolecular modeling, e.g, protein design and molecular discovery. Previously, I did dev and research at MIT, in the [Coley Group](https://coley.mit.edu/), working on AI for synthesis planning. I completed my BS in Computer Science at Purdue University.

I am happy to connect with anyone (especially Malaysian!) who is actively working in the field of AI and sciences, and I would like to hear more about your stories. Feel free to connect!
